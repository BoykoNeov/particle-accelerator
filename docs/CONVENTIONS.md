# Conventions and pitfalls

The bug magnets. Every sign, unit, and coordinate choice is recorded here the
moment it is made. When a result disagrees with an analytic or reference value,
the cause is almost always a mismatch with something on this page — check it
before touching a tolerance.

## State vector

A single fixed 6D layout, matching the Xsuite / MAD-X external ordering so
reference cross-checks are direct (defined in `src/accsim/coords.py`):

| index | name    | meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 0     | `x`     | horizontal position [m] |
| 1     | `px`    | horizontal momentum `Px / P0` (normalised, dimensionless) |
| 2     | `y`     | vertical position [m] |
| 3     | `py`    | vertical momentum `Py / P0` (normalised, dimensionless) |
| 4     | `zeta`  | longitudinal position `s − β₀·c·t` [m]; reference particle has `zeta = 0` |
| 5     | `delta` | relative **momentum** deviation `(P − P0) / P0` (dimensionless) |

- `zeta > 0` ⇒ the particle is **ahead** of the synchronous particle.
- `delta` is a **momentum** deviation, *not* an energy deviation. This choice
  changes the longitudinal transfer-matrix coefficients (see the drift below):
  with `delta`, the drift `R56 = L/γ₀²`; with the energy variable `ptau` it would
  be `L/(β₀²γ₀²)`. We use `delta` because it is the coordinate Xsuite exposes.

## Units

Internal storage: **eV** for energies and momenta (`p0·c` in eV), **metres** for
lengths, **radians**/dimensionless for the normalised momenta. Only the
dimensionless ratios `β₀`, `γ₀` enter the transfer matrices, so the eV choice is
a boundary convenience, not a physics commitment. Convert at the boundary only.

## Reference particle

`E0 = γ₀·m c²`, `β₀ = √(1 − 1/γ₀²)`, `(p0 c)² = E0² − (m c²)²`. Constructors
(`from_total_energy`, `from_kinetic_energy`, `from_momentum`, `from_gamma`) make
the energy specification explicit; the raw dataclass takes total energy.

## Drift transfer matrix (derived, not remembered)

The linear 6×6 drift map is **derived symbolically** from the exact map and pinned
by `tests/analytic/test_drift.py::test_drift_matrix_matches_symbolic_derivation`.

Exact drift of length `L` (independent variable = path length along the
reference), on the normalised coordinates:

```
pz   = √((1+δ)² − px² − py²)            # longitudinal momentum Ps/P0
x  → x + L·px/pz                         # paraxial → linear: x + L·px
y  → y + L·py/pz                         # paraxial → linear: y + L·py
zeta → zeta + L·(1 − β₀·(1+δ)/(pz·β_p))  # time-of-flight slip
```

Linearising about `(px, py, δ) = 0` gives the only non-trivial entries:

```
R12 = ∂x/∂px       = L
R34 = ∂y/∂py       = L
R56 = ∂zeta/∂δ     = L·m²/(P0² + m²) = L/γ₀²   (positive)
```

**Sign of R56:** a higher-momentum particle (`δ > 0`) is faster, arrives earlier,
so `zeta = s − β₀ct` increases ⇒ `R56 > 0`. **Limit:** as `γ₀ → ∞`, `R56 → 0` —
at ultrarelativistic energy all particles travel at ~c regardless of `δ`, so a
straight section produces no longitudinal slip.

> Common trap: the coefficient is `L/γ₀²` **for the momentum variable `δ`**. The
> often-quoted `L/(β₀²γ₀²)` is correct for the *energy* variable `ptau`. They
> agree only as `β₀ → 1`. Using the wrong one is a silent low-energy bug.

## Quadrupole strength sign (Stage 1 — implemented)

`k1 = (1/Bρ)(∂B_y/∂x)` [m⁻²], the MAD-X / Xsuite normalised gradient. The
linearised equations of motion are

```
x'' + k1·x = 0      y'' − k1·y = 0
```

so **`k1 > 0` focuses in `x` and defocuses in `y`** (R21 = −ω·sin ωL < 0 in the
focusing plane). Cross-checked against xtrack's `Quadrupole`
(`tests/reference/test_quadrupole_xtrack.py`): the full 6×6 agrees to ~1e-6,
the focusing/defocusing signs match, and the longitudinal slip
**`R56 = L/γ₀²` is carried *inside* the thick quad** (not sliced into adjacent
drifts). A pure quadrupole has no curvature ⇒ no dispersion.

- **Thick** (`Quadrupole(length, k1)`): closed-form trig block in the focusing
  plane, cosh/sinh in the defocusing plane, with `ω = √|k1|`. Written as one
  analytic family `_focusing_block(g, L)` so `k1 → 0` reduces *exactly* to a
  `Drift` and the sign of `k1` simply swaps the planes. Symplectic by
  construction: it is `exp(L·A)` of the Hamiltonian generator `A` (pinned
  symbolically in `tests/analytic/test_quadrupole.py`).
- **Thin** (`ThinQuadrupole(k1l)`): integrated strength `k1l = k1·L = 1/f`
  [m⁻¹], a zero-length kick `px → px − k1l·x`, `py → py + k1l·y`. No length ⇒
  no longitudinal slip (`R56 = 0`). It is the `L → 0` limit of the thick quad at
  fixed `k1l`; the leading correction to the thin kick is `+k1l²·L/6` (O(L)).

## Dipole — sector bend (Stage 1 — implemented)

`Dipole(length, angle)`: a **pure sector** bend (no pole-face/edge angles, no
gradient `k1`), bending horizontally. Curvature `h = 1/ρ = θ/L`, `θ = angle`.
Edge focusing and combined-function gradients are **Stage 2**, not here. The 6×6
is `exp(L·A)` of the sector-bend Hamiltonian generator (symplectic by
construction); with `C = cos θ`, `S = sin θ`:

```
R11 = R22 = C          R12 = S/h = ρS         R21 = −hS = −S/ρ
R16 = (1−C)/h = ρ(1−C) R26 = S                (dispersion; R16 > 0 ⇒ outward)
R34 = L                                        (vertical = plain drift)
R51 = −S               R52 = (C−1)/h = −R16    (symplectic partners of dispersion)
R56 = ρS − L + L/γ₀²   = L/γ₀² − ρ(θ − S)
```

- **Dispersion sign:** a higher-momentum particle (`δ > 0`) bends less, so it is
  displaced **outward** ⇒ `R16 > 0`.
- **`R51`/`R52` are forced by symplecticity** from the dispersion:
  `R51 = R21·R16 − R11·R26`, `R52 = R22·R16 − R12·R26`. Deriving the map as
  `exp(L·A)` makes this automatic — a hand-built map that gets these wrong fails
  `is_symplectic`.
- **`R56`** is the drift slip `L/γ₀²` (same momentum-variable coefficient as the
  drift/quad) **minus** the extra arc the design orbit travels, `ρ(θ − S)`. The
  momentum-compaction interpretation of this term belongs to Stage 3 — not built
  here.
- **θ → 0 limit:** every curvature term vanishes and the map is exactly a
  `Drift(L)` (`R56 → L/γ₀²`).
- Cross-checked entrywise against xtrack's `Bend` configured as a pure sector
  (`edge_entry/exit_active = 0`, `k1 = 0`) to ~1e-6
  (`tests/reference/test_dipole_xtrack.py`).

## Dispersion in Twiss (Stage 1 — implemented)

The matched linear dispersion `D = (Dx, Dpx, Dy, Dpy) = d(x,px,y,py)/dδ` is the
first-order off-momentum closed orbit. Conventions:

- **Variable is `δ` (momentum):** `D = dx/dδ`. **xtrack's `twiss.dx` uses the
  same `δ` variable** — verified ratio `xtrack.dx / D = 1.0` at γ₀ = 5
  (β₀ ≈ 0.98), decisively **not** the MAD-X `pt`-based `DX = (1/β₀)·dx/dδ`
  (which would differ by ≈ 2% there). Tested at γ₀ = 5 deliberately, so a stray
  `1/β₀` would be an unmistakable 2% gap rather than a 0.1% one
  (`tests/reference/test_dispersion_xtrack.py`).
- **Matched:** `D = (I₄ − M₄)⁻¹·[R16, R26, R36, R46]ᵀ` from the one-turn 4×4
  transverse block `M₄` and its `δ`-column. For an uncoupled lattice with no
  vertical bending, `Dy = Dpy = 0` falls out (the vertical `δ`-column is zero).
- **Propagation is affine:** `D(s₊) = M₄ᵉˡᵉᵐ·D(s) + [R16, R26, R36, R46]ᵀ` —
  matrix transport plus the element's dispersive kick. This is **not** the
  quadratic `B = C·B·Cᵀ` rule used for `β`/`α`; dispersion is an orbit, not a
  second moment.
- A lattice with no bending magnet has `D ≡ 0` everywhere (the `Twiss`
  dispersion fields default to `0.0`).

## Twiss / phase advance / tune (Stage 1 — implemented)

Linear Courant-Snyder optics live in `src/accsim/twiss.py`. Conventions:

- **Matched (periodic) Twiss** comes from the 2×2 transverse blocks of the
  one-turn 6×6: `cos μ = ½·Tr(block)`; `β = M12/sin μ`; `α = (M11−M22)/(2 sin μ)`.
  The matched `β` is **positive by construction** — the sign of `sin μ` is fixed
  by `sign(M12)`, i.e. `sin μ = sign(M12)·√(1−cos²μ)`. Holds even when
  `μ ∈ (π, 2π)` makes `M12 < 0`.
- **Stability** of a plane requires `|½·Tr(block)| < 1` (`|Tr| < 2`). An unstable
  plane has no real matched `β`; `match_periodic`/`closed_twiss` raise
  `UnstableLatticeError` rather than returning a complex β.
- **Propagation** is `B₁ = C·B₀·Cᵀ` with `B = [[β, −α], [−α, γ]]`,
  `γ = (1+α²)/β`. This is exact and preserves the invariant `γβ − α² = 1` when
  `det C = 1` (verified symbolically).
- **`Q = μ_total / 2π`**, and the phase is **accumulated continuously** along the
  lattice — `Δμ = atan2(C12, β₀·C11 − α₀·C12)` per element, summed — **not** taken
  from `acos` of the one-turn matrix. `acos` yields only the *fractional* tune
  (it aliases `μ` into `[0, π]`) and loses the integer part; continuous
  accumulation recovers the full tune. Keep all 2π factors explicit.
- **Scope:** transverse `x`/`y` only (drifts + quads neither couple the planes
  nor disperse, so the 2×2 reduction is exact). Dispersion (coupling to `delta`)
  arrives with the `Dipole`.
- **Cross-check:** a thick-quad FODO ring matches xtrack's 4D Twiss
  (`β`, `α`, `μ/2π`, `Q` in both planes) to **machine precision** (~1e-14, gate
  is <1e-6) — `tests/reference/test_fodo_twiss_xtrack.py`.

### Thin-lens FODO closed form (acceptance gate)

For the symmetric cell `QF/2 − drift(L) − QD − drift(L) − QF/2` (full-quad focal
length `f`, half-cell drift `L`, F split into 2f halves at the ends), derived
symbolically (`tests/analytic/test_fodo_cell.py`):

```
cos μ = 1 − L²/(2f²)        ⇒  sin(μ/2) = L/(2f)
β_max = L_cell·(1 + sin(μ/2)) / sin μ      (at the F centre)
β_min = L_cell·(1 − sin(μ/2)) / sin μ      (at the D centre,  L_cell = 2L)
```

`β_x` peaks at the F quad and troughs at the D quad; `β_y` is the mirror image
(`β_y(F) = β_min`). Because the D quad is a single thin kick (not split), no
element boundary sits exactly at its centre: `β` is continuous across it while
`α` flips sign antisymmetrically, so `α ≠ 0` at the recorded D-centre boundary.

## Natural chromaticity (Stage 2 — implemented)

`natural_chromaticity(lattice)` returns `(Q'_x, Q'_y) = (dQ_x/dδ, dQ_y/dδ)`, the
tune's first-order momentum dependence from the off-momentum weakening of the
quadrupole gradient, `k1 → k1/(1+δ)`. Conventions:

- **Definition is the *un-normalised* derivative** `Q' = dQ/dδ` — **not** the
  normalised `ξ = Q'/Q`. This matches **xtrack's `twiss.dqx`/`dqy`**, pinned by a
  convention guard that finite-differences xtrack's *own* tunes at `δ = ±h` and
  recovers `tw.dqx` (`tests/reference/test_chromaticity_xtrack.py`). A stray `Q`
  or `2π` would show up there.
- **Per-plane signs are opposite** because a quad focuses `x` with `+k1` and `y`
  with `−k1`:
  ```
  Q'_x = −(1/4π) ∮ β_x(s) k1(s) ds
  Q'_y = +(1/4π) ∮ β_y(s) k1(s) ds
  ```
  Both come out **negative** for an ordinary FODO of pure quads (off-momentum
  particles are under-focused). For the FODO cell here `ξ/Q ≈ −1.0` per plane.
- **Thin vs thick.** Thin quads are exact single-point contributions — `β` is
  continuous across a thin kick, so `β·k1l` at the quad is exact. Thick quads are
  integrated by trapezoidal sub-slicing of `β` across the body (`slices=64`
  default): the β-at-the-quad point value is *not* exact when `β` varies over the
  magnet length. Keep the analytic closed-form on thin quads; the thick path is
  cross-checked against xtrack.
- **Scope: quadrupole gradients only.** Drifts contribute nothing; dipole
  weak-focusing / edge chromaticity is **not** computed (flagged — a lattice with
  bends carries an extra, uncomputed dipole term). The Stage 2 FODO acceptance
  lattice is quads + drifts, so this is exact there.
- **Independent validation.** The coefficient and per-plane sign are pinned to
  **machine precision** by differentiating the `δ`-dependent thin one-turn map
  symbolically (`cos μ(δ) = ½ Tr M(δ)`, `Q = μ/2π`, `dQ/dδ|₀`) — a check that
  never touches `β` or `4π`, so it is not circular with the β-sum
  (`tests/analytic/test_chromaticity.py`). The thick β-integration path matches a
  finite-difference tune derivative (always-on) and xtrack's real-particle
  tracking to `rel ≈ 1e-4`.

## Sextupole (Stage 2 — implemented)

A normal sextupole (`Sextupole(length, k2)`, thin `ThinSextupole(k2l)`) applies
the nonlinear kick

```
Δpx = −½ k2l (x² − y²),     Δpy = +k2l (x·y),
```

with `k2 = (1/Bρ)(∂²B_y/∂x²)` [m⁻³] (MAD-X / Xsuite convention) and integrated
strength `k2l = k2·L` [m⁻²]. Conventions:

- **Linear map is a drift.** The Jacobian of the kick at the closed orbit
  `(x, y) = 0` is the identity, so `Sextupole.matrix()` is a drift of length `L`
  (incl. the longitudinal slip `R56 = L/γ₀²`) and `ThinSextupole.matrix()` is the
  identity. A sextupole therefore leaves `β`, dispersion, and the tunes of the
  linear lattice **unchanged** (asserted to `rel 1e-14`). The full nonlinear kick
  (amplitude-dependent tune, dynamic aperture) is **out of Stage 2 scope** — no
  nonlinear tracking map is implemented.
- **Chromaticity feed-down** is the Stage-2 "linear effect." At dispersion
  `x = x_β + D_x·δ`, the quadratic kick yields a `δ`-dependent linear gradient
  `k1_eff = k2·D_x·δ`, shifting the chromaticity by
  ```
  Q'_x += +(1/4π) ∮ β_x k2 D_x ds
  Q'_y += −(1/4π) ∮ β_y k2 D_x ds
  ```
  The per-plane signs are **opposite to the quad** natural term (`+k2·D_x` vs
  `−k1`), which is exactly what lets a sextupole at `D_x > 0` push a negative
  natural chromaticity back toward zero. Vanishes on a dispersion-free (drift +
  quad) lattice.
- **`natural_chromaticity` vs `chromaticity`.** `natural_chromaticity` keeps its
  term-of-art meaning — the **bare quad-gradient** chromaticity (the negative
  number sextupoles correct); since a sextupole's map is a drift it contributes
  zero there, untouched. `chromaticity(lattice)` = `natural_chromaticity` + the
  sextupole feed-down. **Neither is a complete absolute total:** both omit the
  dipole's own weak-focusing / edge chromaticity (out of scope), and feed-down is
  nonzero only when bends are present — so an uncomputed dipole term always
  coexists with it. The validated deliverables are the *feed-down term itself*,
  the accsim-internal *correction* (feed-down cancels the quad natural term), and
  the *difference* cross-check below.
- **Thin vs thick.** Thin sextupoles are exact single-point contributions (`β` and
  `D_x` continuous across the zero-length kick); thick sextupoles integrate
  `β·D_x` by trapezoidal sub-slicing across the drift-like body (`slices=64`), which
  converges to the thin value quadratically in the length.
- **Independent validation.** The coefficient and per-plane sign are pinned to
  **machine precision** by the symbolic `δ`-dependent trace derivative — modelling
  the sextupole as the thin quad `k1l_eff = k2l·D_x·δ`, never touching `β` or `4π`
  (`tests/analytic/test_sextupole.py`). That check shares the feed-down *model*
  (sextupole ≡ extra quad) with the formula, so the **xtrack cross-check** is the
  one that validates the model itself: it tracks the real nonlinear kick and
  compares the **with-minus-without-sextupole difference** (toggling `k2` at fixed
  geometry, so `β`/dispersion/tunes — hence the shared dipole term — cancel
  exactly). accsim's feed-down matches xtrack's `Δdqx`/`Δdqy` to `rel ≈ 2e-3`
  (`tests/reference/test_sextupole_xtrack.py`).

## Stability boundary (Stage 2 — validated)

A transverse plane is stable iff its one-turn 2×2 block obeys `|½·Tr| < 1`
(`|Tr M| < 2`); an unstable plane has no real matched `β` and `match_periodic`/
`closed_twiss` raise `UnstableLatticeError` (see *Twiss* above). Stage 2's
acceptance ties this trace test to the analytic **phase-advance limit**:

- For the symmetric thin FODO (full-quad focal length `f`, half-cell drift `L`),
  `cos μ = 1 − L²/(2f²)`. The upper edge `cos μ = +1` is just the no-focusing
  `f → ∞` limit, so the *only reachable* instability is the over-focusing edge
  `cos μ = −1`, at `f_crit = L/2`, where the phase advance per cell reaches
  `μ = π`. A symmetric FODO therefore has **one** boundary, not two, and both
  planes hit it together (`μ_x = μ_y`).
- **Anti-circularity:** `is_stable` *is* `|½·Tr| < 1`, so `f_crit` is derived
  **symbolically** from `Tr M = −2` (hand-built thin matrices, no accsim) and the
  element chain must reproduce it: `½·Tr → −1` in both planes at `f_crit`,
  `is_stable` flips across it, the stable region matches the hand criterion
  `sin(μ/2) = L/(2f) < 1` over a focal-length sweep, and the **independent**
  `tunes()` atan2 accumulation sends `Q → ½` (μ → π) as `f → f_crit⁺`. Pinned by
  `tests/analytic/test_stability_boundary.py`.
- **Caveat (parametrising by target μ):** `f = L/(2 sin(μ/2))` maps `μ` and
  `2π − μ` to the *same* `f`, so it only reaches the stable range `(0, π)` — the
  unstable side is reached by lowering `f` below `f_crit`, never by pushing a
  target μ past π. Also `β_max ∝ 1/sin μ` diverges at the boundary, so μ-target
  checks stay off it (μ ≈ 0.9π).

## Beam envelope / beam size (Stage 2 — implemented)

The 1-σ transverse beam envelope adds the betatron width and the momentum-spread
offset **in quadrature** — they are statistically independent in a matched beam,
so there is no cross term and no coefficient to remember:

    σ_u(s) = √( ε_u · β_u(s) + (D_u(s) · σ_δ)² ),   u ∈ {x, y}.

- `ε_x`, `ε_y` are **geometric** (not normalised) emittances [m·rad]; `σ_δ` is the
  RMS relative *momentum* spread `σ(δ)` (dimensionless, same `δ` as the state
  vector). All three are **inputs**, not computed — there is no radiation/RF yet to
  set an equilibrium (that arrives in Stages 3/5). `σ_δ = 0` gives the pure
  betatron envelope `√(ε_u β_u)`.
- Each plane uses **its own** dispersion `D_u`, so vertical dispersion is included
  for free if a lattice ever produces it; a flat, uncoupled lattice has `D_y = 0`,
  so `σ_y` is betatron-only there.
- Units check: `D_u` [m], `σ_δ` dimensionless, `ε_u·β_u` [m·rad] ≈ [m] → `σ_u` [m].
- The physics lives in `accsim.beam_sigma` (testable); `plotting.plot_beam_envelope`
  and the `emittance=` branch of `plot_beta_functions` (betatron-only, `σ_δ = 0`)
  both call it — there is deliberately **one** σ formula in the codebase.
- **Validation:** the discriminating check needs dispersion, so it runs on an arc
  cell *with a dipole* (`D_x ≠ 0`) and asserts the exact decomposition
  `σ_x² − ε_x β_x == (D_x σ_δ)²` at every point, plus `σ → √(εβ)` when `σ_δ = 0`
  (`tests/analytic/test_beam_envelope.py`). **No xtrack cross-check** is warranted:
  the envelope is pure algebra over `β` and `D`, both already xtrack-validated in
  Stage 1; the analytic quadrature test covers the only new thing.

## Symplecticity

A linear map is symplectic iff `Mᵀ J M = J` (`accsim.symplectic`). Thin-lens kicks
composed with exact drifts are symplectic; thick-element matrices must be exact
closed-form maps, not truncated expansions. Any shortcut that breaks
symplecticity must be flagged — it silently damps or blows up long-term tracking.

Caveat: `(zeta, delta)` is canonically conjugate only in the constant-velocity
approximation used by the linear maps; the strictly-canonical longitudinal pair
is `(zeta, ptau)`. For the linear drift this does not break the `Mᵀ J M = J`
check, but it is flagged for the longitudinal stages (Stage 3+).

## Toolchain / environment notes

- **Python 3.14** is the development interpreter. `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`,
  `sympy`, `pytest`, `ruff` all work on it.
- **Reference code is `xtrack`, not the `xsuite` umbrella.** The `xsuite`
  meta-package fails to build on 3.14 because `xcoll` (collimation/FLUKA) hits a
  `pathlib` change (`UnsupportedOperation: cannot instantiate 'FsPath'`). The core
  tracker `xtrack` installs and imports fine, and is all the optics cross-checks
  need. The `reference` optional dependency is therefore `xtrack`.
- **xtrack JIT compilation — RESOLVED 2026-06-29 (now live via clang-cl).**
  `xtrack` compiles C kernels on first use via `cffi` → the platform C compiler.
  On Windows that path had three independent failure layers; all are now handled
  by the `tests/reference/_xtrack_jit.py` fix-up (applied from
  `tests/reference/conftest.py`). The diagnosis, kept for the record:
  1. Needs `setuptools` in the venv (stdlib `distutils` gone on 3.12+) — installed.
  2. **xobjects discards compiler flags on Windows.** In
     `xobjects/context_cpu.py::compile_kernel`, the `os.name == "nt"` branch sets
     `xtr_compile_args = []` (literal comment `# TODO: to be handled properly`),
     throwing away **both** the computed `-I<site-packages>` include flag (→
     `C1083: cannot open 'xtrack/multisetter/multisetter.h'`) **and** the
     `-DXO_CONTEXT_CPU` / `-DXO_CONTEXT_CPU_SERIAL` context defines (→ `C1189:
     Unknown context`). The spaced project path is **not** the cause — it is passed
     to the compiler as a single argv element correctly (corrects the earlier
     "spaced path" hypothesis).
  3. **xtrack's own C source is not MSVC-clean.** Past layers 1–2, MSVC `cl.exe`
     rejects xtrack source with `C2166: l-value specifies const object`
     (`track_misalignments.h`, the `S_SHIFT(part0, -mis_s)` macro on a negated
     `const`). GCC/Clang accept this; MSVC's stricter front-end is the outlier —
     xsuite is developed on Linux.
  - **Fix that worked:** compile with **clang-cl** instead of `cl.exe`. clang-cl is
    a cl-compatible front-end that reproduces the reference toolchain's GCC/Clang
    behaviour (clearing the `C2166`) while emitting MSVC-ABI objects the MSVC
    linker links. The `_xtrack_jit` fix-up monkeypatches the distutils MSVC
    compiler to: swap `self.cc → clang-cl`, re-add `site-packages` to the include
    path, restore the `XO_CONTEXT_CPU*` defines, and drop `/GL`+`/LTCG` (clang-cl
    bitcode is incompatible with the MSVC linker's LTCG). It is a **no-op** off
    Windows and when clang-cl is absent, so reference tests skip gracefully there.
    Requires `winget install LLVM.LLVM` (clang-cl 22.x verified); `xpart` must also
    be installed (xtrack's R-matrix/Twiss helpers import it).
  - **Dead ends checked:** `pip install xsuite-prebuilt-kernels` → no PyPI
    distribution. Relocating to a space-free path → would not help (layer 2 is
    path-independent).
  - **Status:** `tests/reference/test_drift_xtrack.py` now **passes** (not skips) —
    the full 6×6 drift map agrees with xtrack to ~1.5e-10 (`R56 = L/γ₀²`, the
    momentum-variable value `0.5` for `γ₀=2`, confirming it over the energy-variable
    `0.667`; sign `+`). This validates the **Stage 0** drift convention against the
    reference. It is **not** Stage 1 acceptance (the FODO Twiss `<1e-6` check is
    still ahead), and the `zeta`-sign reconciliation is settled **for the drift
    R56 only** — keep the flag live for quads/dipoles/full-ring in Stage 1.
  - **CI note:** CI runs ruff + the analytic suite only; the `reference` marker is
    not exercised in CI (and clang-cl is not installed there). This cross-check is
    therefore a **local Windows gate**, not a per-push CI regression catch.
- **(Historical, resolved)** The `zeta` sign was expected to possibly mismatch
  Xsuite on first cross-check — a convention reconciliation, not a physics bug.
  **Outcome:** no mismatch. Drift, quad, and dipole 6×6 maps agree with xtrack with
  no sign flip (see the ROADMAP: the `zeta`-sign question is **settled**).
- **(Historical)** Before the JIT was fixed the drift convention rested solely on
  the **symbolic derivation** (two independent routes agree) — itself a gold-standard
  analytic check. That derivation still stands and is now *also* corroborated by the
  passing xtrack cross-check above.
